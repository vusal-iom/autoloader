Use @docs/scheduler-implementation-guide.md implementing the next feature. 
Please check the current implementation to understand what has been done so far. 
Pick next potential deliverable from there. First explain your plan for implementing it in a concise manner. 
Once we are good implement the test and the feature. Deliverable should be test and feature implementation.



please read all the docs and docs folder and figure out what would be potential high level items we need to work. Cross check code base also to see what is 
implemented/not implemented
