Create a comprehensive unit test strategy document for a module.

First, ask me: "Which module, class, or file would you like to create unit tests for?"

Then create a detailed markdown document following this structure:
- Test coverage goals and priorities
- List all test cases with WHY they exist and WHAT they cover
- Use P0/P1/P2 prioritization
- Focus on business value and edge cases
- Save as `docs/test-strategies/unit/[module].md`

Each test case should explain:
- Why this test exists (business reason)
- What functionality it validates
- Expected behavior
- Edge cases to consider
