Implement tests one at a time from a test strategy document.


Always apply "ultrathink"

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. First ask: "Which test strategy document should I use?"
2. Read the strategy and list all test cases
3. Ask which ONE test to implement
4. Write ONLY that single test
5. Run it immediately with pytest
6. Fix if it fails
7. Ask if user wants the next test

Never write multiple tests at once. Always run each test before proceeding.

If you don't follow these rules strictly you will be penalized!
